# tym2

_tym, but redone in C/C++ because i want to go lower..._

## Features

* Designed (currently) to serve static HTML, JS, CSS, PNG, and JSON files.
* This means it can serve very simple web pages or even a basic website with links and such.

In short: tym2 is planned to be a framework for which simple websites can be served across light hardware.
Right now (this inital series of commits), tym2 serves little more than a tutorial/sample piece of how one might use libmicrohttpd within C++.
(and as such this shares a lot in common with the sample code found at https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/)


## Planned Features

* configurable routes.
* Postgresql support.
* optional gzipping.
* Further samples (other than that already provided).
* a foundational/bare-bones CMS (that can be configured and made to look nice, this author isn't a designer sorry)
* _interstellar travel?_


## TODO Next

* makefile.
